这次我想继续上次的制作。我还有很多的音频没有结束。
Jo推荐我可以去不同的地方感受自然，在自然之下绘画。

This time, I wanted to more deliberately approach the theme of 'landscape' — not just as something to be seen, but through how a place can be experienced sonically."

By recording their calls and mixing them with ambient urban sounds, I’m trying to construct a sonic terrain—one that doesn’t rely on visual representation, but still conveys a sense of place. These soundtracks are not just background—they directly inform the rhythm and density of the printed image.

I’m interested in the idea that landscape is not only what we see, but what we hear, repeatedly, every day, often without noticing. Animals, for me, are an entry point into this idea—not as metaphor, but as very real “neighbors” and sound-sources embedded in daily life.

Formally, I’m working on translating those rhythms and textures of sound into visual structures—through repetition, interruption, and fragmentation in the composition.

Some of the birdsong frequencies are converted into waveform drawings, then printed using etching or screenprint techniques, turning sound into something tactile: noise as trace, voice as mark.

I’m also experimenting with layering these sound-based forms to create visual fields that function almost like sonic topographies—each layer becoming a kind of auditory cross-section of a space.
